Create scripts to test ETL flow between the dw_source, dw_stage and dw_store layers based on the data mapping sheet created in the previous task. WITH clause can be useful.
The task has to be drawn up in the Microsoft Word obeying the following structure:

task condition,
the SQL script listing (send it as a separate file, if it is too long),
a screenshot with the script and resulting table from SQL Server Management Studio.

      3. If the bugs are detected, they should be reported.
Note: Use previously installed SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio to run the SQL scripts.
